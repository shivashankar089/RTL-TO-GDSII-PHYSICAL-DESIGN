## 1. Introduction

Day 6 compares a design before and after synthesis. The pre-synthesis view represents the RTL-level design, while the post-synthesis view represents the implementation-oriented structure produced by synthesis.

## 2. Objective

- Inspect the design before synthesis.
- Understand the purpose of RTL synthesis.
- Compare pre-synthesis and post-synthesis structures.
- Check that synthesis preserves the intended design behavior.

## 3. Design Description

The design is represented at RTL before synthesis and as a synthesized implementation afterward. Synthesis translates the behavioral description into a gate-level structure suitable for later implementation steps.

## 4. Pre-Synthesis View

The pre-synthesis reference shows the original design representation before synthesis transforms the RTL into technology-oriented logic.

## 5. Synthesis

During synthesis, the RTL is analyzed and mapped into an implementation structure. The resulting representation can differ visually from the RTL while preserving the design intent.

## 6. Post-Synthesis View

The post-synthesis reference shows the structure after synthesis. Comparing it with the pre-synthesis image helps identify the structural changes introduced by logic mapping and optimization.

## 7. Results

- Pre-synthesis and post-synthesis design views are available for comparison.
- The synthesized representation provides an implementation-oriented view of the RTL.
- The comparison supports functional-equivalence and structural inspection.

## 8. Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates the transition from RTL description to synthesized hardware and prepares the design for later physical implementation stages.

### 1. `pre_synthesis.png` - Design before synthesis

This view shows the design's RTL representation before synthesis transforms and maps its logic.

### 2. `post_synthesis.png` - Design after synthesis

This view shows the design after synthesis. Compare its structure with the pre-synthesis view to see how logic mapping and optimization changed the representation.
